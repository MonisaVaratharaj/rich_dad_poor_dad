        <h1>Essence of the Book: Rich Dad Poor Dad</h1>
        <p><em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em> is a starting point for anyone looking to gain control of their financial future.</p>
        
     <p> <em> " This book is designed not only for those aiming to become rich but also to impart essential knowledge about finance that everyone needs." </p> </em>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated and intelligent. He had a Ph.D. and completed four years of undergraduate work in less than two years. He then went on to Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University to do his advanced studies, all on full financial scholarships. The other father never finished the eighth grade. Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives. Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one always struggled financially. The other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities, and his church. The other left bills to be paid.</p>

        <p>The problem was that the rich man was not rich yet, and the poor man was not yet poor. Both were just starting out on their careers, and both were struggling with money and families. But they had very different points of view about money. As a young boy, having two strong fathers influencing me was difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers did not say the same things. The contrast in their points of view, particularly about money, shaped my thinking profoundly.</p>

        <p>
        One dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other created investments. One dad taught me how to write an
impressive resumé so I could find a good job. The other taught me how to write strong business and financial plans
so I could create jobs. 
</p>
<p> My poor dad would say, <b> " I’m not interested in money " or " Money doesn’t matter. " </b>  My rich dad always said, " Money is
power. " </p>

     

        <p>One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is taught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about money from our parents. So what can poor parents tell their child about money? They simply say, “Stay in school and study hard.”</p>
        <p> Although both men had tremendous respect for education and learning, they disagreed about what they
thought was important to learn. One wanted me to study hard, earn a degree, and get a good job to earn money. He
wanted me to study to become a professional, an attorney or an accountant.
The other(rich dad) encouraged me to study to be rich, to understand how money works, and to learn how to have it work for me.
<b> " I don’t work for money! " </b> were words he would repeat over and over. <b> " Money works for me! " </b> </p>

     <p> At the age of nine, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich dad about money. In doing so, I chose not to listen
to my poor dad, even though he was the one with all the college degrees.
Once I made up my mind about whom to listen to, my education about money began. My rich dad taught me over
a period of 30 years until I was 39 years old. </p>
