        <h1>CHAPTER 3 : THE POOR AND RICH MINDSET </h1>
      
     <h2> Rule #2: MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS </h2>  
  <p>  The primary reason the majority of the poor and middle
class are fiscally conservative—which means, “I can’t afford
to take risks”—is that they have no financial foundation. <br> <br>

<b> Poor and Middle class mindset : </b> <br> <br>
 “I need a raise” , “If only I
had a promotion ”, “I am going back to school to get more
training so I can get a better job ”, “I am going to work
overtime ”, “Maybe I can get a second job.” <br> <br>

<b> Rich people mindset :  </b> <br> <br>


• Building assets <br>
• Generating cashflow through assets <br> 
• Building businesses that does not require presence - (take a pause and think about this ) <br> <br>

Lets say you are an employee of a company. The job requires your entire presence (that is you spent 8-10 hrs in your job and selling your skill and earning money. You have to put all your time and effort in your job and earn money,yeah that job requires your absolute presence, if you dont present in your job, it will never get done. This is what is called active income- where you actively engage in your job. <br> <br>

You start a YouTube channel where you share **travel videos**. At first, you spend time filming, editing, and uploading videos. Once your channel grows, people start watching your videos, and you make money from ads. You also add links to travel gear in your video descriptions, earning money if people buy through those links. After the videos are uploaded, they keep earning money even when you're not working on new content. This is called passive income.
<br> <br>

Now get to the point,  businesses should run passively, that shouldn't require your presence. <br> <br>

<b> Robert kiyosaki : </b> <br> <br>

Businesses that do not require my presence but I own
them, but they are managed or run by other
people. If I have to work there, it’s not a business.
It becomes my job. <br> <br>
• Stocks <br>
• Bonds <br>
• Income-generating real estate <br>
• Notes (IOUs) <br>
• Royalties from intellectual property such as
music, scripts, and patents <br>
• Anything else that has value, produces income or
appreciates, and has a ready market <br> <br> 

I don’t encourage anyone to start a company unless they
really want to. 
There are
times when people can’t find employment and starting a
company seems like the best solution. But the odds are
against success: Nine out of ten companies fail in five years.
Of those that survive the first five years, nine out of every
ten of those eventually fail as well. So only if you really have
the desire to own your own company do I recommend it. <br> <br>

The main management skills needed for
success are: <br> <br>
1. Management of cash flow <br>
2. Management of systems <br>
3. Management of people <br> <br>

There are five main reasons why
financially literate people may still not develop abundant
asset columns that could produce a large cash flow. The five
reasons are: <br> <br>
1. Fear <br>
2. Cynicism <br>
3. Laziness <br>
4. Bad habits <br>
5. Arrogance <br> <br>



I think I have made my message clear. It’s what is in your
head that determines what is in your hands. Money is only
an idea. There is a great book called <b>" Think and Grow Rich. "
The title is not **Work Hard and Grow Rich.** </b> Learn to have
money work hard for you, and your life will be easier and
happier. Today, don’t play it safe. Play it smart. <br> 

<br><b> – Robert Kiyosaki </b><br> <br>



Take a break from your life and think about where you are running behind. Are you seriously working for money, or is money working for you? We all grow up with many negative thoughts about money, such as: "Rich people are greedy," "Money is evil," "Only selfish people own money," and "Money is not important; only education is important." These are the thoughts we are usually surrounded by and receive from our parents, teachers, and society.
But that's not the truth. <br> <br>
The real problem lies in their minds, due to their lack of knowledge about financial education. They are not capable of making more money, so they make excuses like, "Having more money and wealth is too greedy. Money is not important." <br> <br>
They simply hide their lack of financial education through these excuses. Since you are always surrounded by them, these thoughts get stored in your subconscious mind, resulting in negative feelings about money.
But honestly, I agree with the point that money doesn't bring happiness. Yes, that's correct. Making money is important, but it won’t bring you happiness—it will give you choices in life and help you live a comfortable lifestyle.
<br> <br>
There are also people who have reached great heights through formal education, but they are very few. What about the rest of us?  <br> <br>

Through this blog, I am not suggesting you immediately quit your job, drop your education, and start your own company.
I just want to spread awareness about this book. I hope you have learned something new today. Research more, learn more, and read a lot of books where you can find solutions to your problems. My intention with this blog is to create a reading habit in you. In India, only a small percentage of people read books, which is a sad reality. Start reading today —one book can change your life.  <br> <br>

Share this knowledge with your friends, family, and loved ones, and light up their lives. Choose prosperity.  <br> <br>

With a smile,  <br>
