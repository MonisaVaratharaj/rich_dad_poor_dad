        <figcaption>THE THREE CLASS MODEL OF THE WORLD</figcaption>
<h3> <b> Class I: The Elite </b> </h3>
<p>

At the top is the Elite (Class I)â€”the rich, powerful, and famous. These are industrialists, entrepreneurs, politicians, CEOs, movie stars, sportspeople, and others at the peak of their fields. They make up about 1% of the population, yet control most of the worldâ€™s resources, money, and power. </p>
<p>
They donâ€™t conspire against others, but they naturally act in their own best interests, ensuring that they and their children remain in this privileged position. The world is structured in a way that benefits them, making it extremely difficult for others to reach their level.
 </p>
<h3> <b> Class II: Elite Servers, Protectors</b> </h3>

<p>
This 9% of the population serves and protects the Elite. These include doctors, engineers, lawyers, bankers, high-ranking government officials, and corporate managers. They have significant influence and wealth, but they still work for the Elite.

Many in this class guard the system, making sure the majority (Class III) stays in place. They also ensure that only a select few from their own ranks can move into the Elite.
 </p>


<h3> <b> Class III: Drones, Workers and Slaves </h3> </b>
<p>
This is the largest group (90%), consisting of middle-class and lower-class workers. They include clerks, drivers, waiters, delivery workers, janitors, shop staff, and factory workers. They earn just enough to survive but struggle to accumulate wealth.

Even when they try to save, unexpected expenses (like medical bills) push them into debt. They canâ€™t afford elite education for their children, so the cycle of struggle continues.<br> <br>

Even if Class IIIs try their best , they never accumulate reasonable wealth or assets. The Iron Gates, which we will discuss in the next section, are extra strong here to prevent Class IIIs from moving up. <br> <br> </p>


       <h3> <b> The Iron Gates : Barriers to Success</h3> </b>

<p>The Iron Gates are the invisible barriers that keep people in their class. These include: <br> 
<ul>
 
<li> <p>Lack of financial resources </li>
<li> <p>Limited access to top-tier education  </li>
<li> <p>No connections to influential people  </li>
<li> <p>A system designed to favor those already at the top  </li>

<li><p> While some people do break through, it is rare. The Elite ensure that most wealth and power remain in their hands.   </p></li>
</ul>
</p>
        <h3> <b> Your Goal: To Cross Your Aukaat and Jump Class </h3> </b>
<p>
You canâ€™t choose where youâ€™re born, but you can choose to break out. In India, thereâ€™s a concept called "Aukaat", which refers to oneâ€™s status or reach in life. Jumping class means crossing your aukaatâ€”and thatâ€™s exactly what you need to do. </p> 

<b> <p class="highlight-text">There is pain in progress, but also pain in stagnation.</b></p>

<p>If you want success, you must fight for it. If youâ€™re ready to break the Iron Gates and rise above, I will teach you 11 secret rules to success. Follow them with focus and commitment, and you will win. <br><br>
