        <h1>CHAPTER 1 : THE RICH DON'T WORK FOR MONEY </h1>
      
        <p> 
I am Robert Kiyosaki, and I am 9 years old. I had two dads: one was my own father, who had great education, a PhD, and many degrees, and the other was Mike's father. Mike is my schoolmate. One day, I asked my father, "How can I become rich?" After a while, he replied, "I don't have an idea, but I’m sure Mike's father is building an empire, so he might be able to help you." ( I - Robert Kiyosaki here always )  </p> 
        

        <h2>The Lessons Begin </h2>
        <p> Mike and I met with his dad the next day morning. He was already busy. "Ready, boys?" he asked. <br>  <br>
Okay, here’s my offer. " I’ll teach you to be rich, but I won’t do it classroom-style. If you work for me, I’ll teach you. If you don’t
work for me, I won’t teach you. I can teach you faster if you work, and I’m wasting my time if you just want to sit and
listen like you do in school. That’s my offer. Take it or leave it." <br>  <br>

" Ah, may I ask a question first? "  I asked. <b> " No. Take it or leave it.Opportunities come and go. Being able to know when to
make quick decisions is an important skill " </b> said Rich dad." I’ll take it, " I replied, choosing to work and learn
instead of playing. I and Mike worked for rich dad for three hours every Saturday and earned about 30 cents.(10 cents/hr) </p> 
        
      <h2> Waiting in Line on Saturday </h2> 
    
     <p>
I was ready to face Mike’s dad. Even my real dad was angry with him. My real dad, the one I call the poor one,thought that my rich dad was violating child labor laws and should be investigated.My educated, poor dad told me to demand what I deserve—at least 25 cents an hour.I was waiting for a long time and finally rich dad came.  <br> <br>
  
"You said that you would teach me if I worked for you. Well, I’ve worked for you. I’ve worked hard. I’ve given up my baseball games to work for you, but you haven’t kept your word, and you haven’t taught me anything. You are a crook like everyone in town thinks you are. You’re greedy.You want all the money and don’t take care of your employees." <br> <br>

" I am teaching you " rich dad said quietly. <br> <br>

<b> " What have you taught me? Nothing! " </b> I said angrily. <br> <br>

" How do you know that I’ve not taught you anything? "
asked rich dad calmly.

" Well, you’ve never talked to me. I’ve worked for three weeks and you have not taught me anything " I said. <br> <br>

" Does teaching mean talking or a lecture?” rich dad asked. “Well, yes,” I replied. 
	     “That’s how they teach you in school,” he said, smiling.What is this man talking about?”
	     I asked myself silently.
" If you learn life’s lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just continue to push you around. 
	     People do two things. Some just let life push them around. Others get angry and push back. 
	     But they push back against their boss, or their job, or their husband or wife. 
	     They do not know it’s life that’s pushing." <br> <br>

Rich dad looked over at me. We stared at each other, communicating through our eyes. Finally, I had
absorbed his message. I knew he was right. I was blaming him, and I did ask to learn. I was fighting.
  <br> <br>

<b> " You boys are the first people who have ever asked me to teach  how to make money. I have more than 150 employees, and not one of them asked me what I know about money. They ask me for a job and a paycheck, but never to teach them about money. So most will spend the
best years of their lives working for money, not really understanding what it is they are working for." </b> <br> <br>

 So what is the lesson I learned from working for only 10 cents an hour? " I asked. <br>  <br> 

<b> " You’d best change your point of view. Stop blaming me and thinking I’m the problem. If you think I’m the
problem, then you have to change me. If you realize that you’re the problem, then you can change yourself, learn
something, and grow wiser. Most people want everyone else in the world to change but themselves. Let me tell you, it’s
easier to change yourself than everyone else." </b> <br>  <br>

" I don’t understand, " I said. <br>  <br>

" Don’t blame me for your problems," rich dad said. " So what should I do? " I asked. “Just take this measly 10
cents an hour and smile?” <br>  <br>

Rich dad smiled. <em> <b> "That’s what the other people do. Waiting for a pay raise thinking that more
money will solve their problems. Most just accept it, and some take a second job working harder, but again
accepting a small paycheck." </b> </em> Finally, I looked up and asked, " So what will solve the problem? " <br> <br> 

" This, " he said - " This stuff between your ears." <br>  <br>

        </div>

It was at that moment that rich dad shared the pivotal point of view that separated him from his employees 
	    and my poor dad. Rich dad explained this point of view over and over,which 
	    I call lesson number one: <b> " The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them." </b>


</p>
       

<p>At nine years old, you’ve gotten a taste of what it feels like to work for money. Just multiply your last 3 weeks by fifty years and you will have an idea of what most people spend their life doing.</p>
    
    <p>" I don’t understand, " I said. " <em> If you choose to work for money, that is what life will be like, " </em> said rich dad.</p>

    <p>" And how did you feel when you received three cents in your hand for three hours of work? "</p>
    <p>" I felt like it wasn’t enough. It seemed like nothing. I was disappointed, " I said.</p>
    
    <p>" And that is how most employees feel when they look at their paychecks(salary) — especially after all the tax and other deductions are taken out."</p>
    
    <p> <b> " The government always takes its share first by taxes. You’re taxed when you earn. You’re taxed when you spend. You’re taxed when you save. You’re taxed when you die, " </b> said rich dad. </p>

    <p>Why do people let the government do that to them?” I asked. "The rich don't. The poor and the middle class do. I’ll bet you that I earn more than your dad, yet your more educated dad pays more in taxes.”</p>

    <p>" Why would someone let the government do that to them? " I asked. Rich dad , just looking at me. " Ready to learn? " he asked. I nodded.</p>
    
    <p>" As I said, there is a lot to learn. Learning how to have money work for you is a lifetime study. 
	    Most people go to college for four years, and their education ends. 
	    They go to work, get their paycheck, balance their checkbooks, and that’s it. 
	    Then they wonder why they have money problems. 
	    They think that more money will solve the problem and don’t realize that it’s their lack of financial education that is the problem."</p>

    <p>" Look, " said rich dad, “taxes are just one small section on learning how to have money work 
	    for you. Today, I just wanted to find out if you still have the passion to learn about 
	    money. Most people don’t. They want to go to school, learn a profession, have fun at their 
	    work, and earn lots of money.
	    One day they wake up with big money problems, and then they can’t stop working and can't do anything. So do you still have the passion to learn?” asked rich dad.</p>

    <p>I nodded my head.</p>

    <p>“Good,” said rich dad. <b> “Now get back to work. This time, I will pay you nothing.” </b> </p>

    <p>What?” I asked in amazement. “You heard me. Nothing. You will work the same three hours, but this time you will not be paid 10 cents per hour. You said you wanted to learn to not work for money, so I’m not going to pay you anything.”</p>

    <p>I stood there, still not believing what a raw deal I was handed. I came to ask for a pay raise, and somehow I was instead working for nothing.
	    Rich dad tapped me on the head again and said, “Use this. Now get out of here and get back to work.”</p>
 <p> We started working for rich dad for nothing. </p>

    <h2>Lesson #2: Avoiding One of Life’s Biggest Traps</h2>
    <p>Rich dad stopped by at noon on the third week.</p>
    <p>" Let’s go for a walk, boys." We crossed the street, sitting down at a  picnic table in a park .</p>
    
    <p>" How’s it going, boys? "</p>
    <p>" Okay," Mike said. I nodded in agreement.</p>

    <p>" Learn anything yet? " rich dad asked.</p>
    <p>Mike and I looked at each other.</p>

    <p>" Well, you boys had better start thinking. You’re staring at one of life’s biggest lessons.
	    If you learn it, you’ll enjoy a life of great freedom and security. 
	    If you don’t, you’ll wind up like most of the people playing in this park. 
	    They work very hard for little money, clinging to the illusion of job security and looking 
	    forward to a three-week vacation each year and maybe a skimpy pension after forty-five years of
	    service. If that excites you, I’ll give you a raise to 25 cents an hour.Then he added giving $1, $2 and $5 for an hour."
	    My brain was screaming and my heart exploded ,even adults in those days getting paid 5$ an hour is ridiculous, but we got that offer 
	    which kept me think that I am the richest kid in the world. But I and Mike kept silent. </p>
    
        <p>
" Good," rich dad said softly. " Most people have a price.
And they have a price because of human emotions named
fear and greed. First, the fear of being without money
motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that
paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the
wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set. "
" What pattern ? " I asked. <br> <br>

<b> " The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills; get up, go
to work, pay bills. People’s lives are forever controlled by
two emotions: fear and greed. Offer them more money and
they continue the cycle by increasing their spending. This is
what I call the Rat Race." </b> <br> 
" There is another way? " Mike asked. <br>
" Yes.But only a few people find
it " smiled rich dad.
</p> <br>

<p> Rich dad said <b> " I’ve met so many people who say, ‘Oh, I’m
not interested in money.’ Yet they’ll work at a job for eight
hours a day. But if they weren’t
interested in money, then why are they working? " </b>

As I sat there listening to my rich dad, my mind flashed
back to the countless times my own dad said, " I’m not
interested in money. " He said those words often. He also
covered himself by always saying, " I work because I love my job." 
</p>
<p> 
" Then why people are working so hard in a job ? " we asked.
<p> <b> " A job is really a shortterm solution to a long-term problem.But most people think that only job solve their financial problems. This makes them work for their entire future, but at the end , it left them with nothing. " </b>

But my highly educated dad is always saying, <b> <em> ‘Stay in school and get
good grades, so you can find a safe, secure job,’ </b> </em> " I
interjected, somewhat confused. </p>
<p> Look, school is very important. You go to school to learn
a skill or profession to become a contributing member of
society. Every culture needs teachers, doctors, mechanics,
artists, cooks, businesspeople, police officers
and soldiers. Schools train them so society can 
flourish, " said rich dad. <b>  " Unfortunately, for many people
school is the end, not the beginning. " </b>
There was a long silence. Rich dad was smiling. </p>

<p>
" <b> Remember a job is only a short-term
solution to a long-term problem. Most people have only one
problem in mind, and it’s short-term. It’s the bills at the end
of the month.Money controls their lives.
So they do as their parents did. They get up every day and
go work for money, not taking the time to ask the question,
‘Is there another way?’ Their emotions now control their
thinking, not their heads. " </b>  <br> <br>

<b> <em> Seeing What Others Miss : </b> </em> Keep working boys, but the sooner you forget about needing a paycheck, the easier your adult life will be. 
	    Keep using your brain, 
work for free, and soon your mind will show you new ways of making money.
	    You will see things that other people never see. Most people never see these
opportunities because they’re looking for money and security, so that’s all they get. <br> <br> 

We spent the next week at school thinking and talking,too. For two more weeks, we kept working for free. </p>
<p> Have you ever noticed your parents complaining about their life, job, and financial situation? 
	Other than blaming the situation, did they ever take another step to solve their problem? Or at 
	least think about why financial crises keep happening, even after working hard for 8-12 hours a day? 
	Everyone is working hard. Look at the man constructing the road—he works the entire day under the 
	blazing summer sun, yet he still faces financial struggles. On the other hand, some people make lots of 
	money while working only 3-4 hours a day. What is the difference? Both are working (especially the man 
	who constructs hard) and earning money, but what makes them different? <br> <br> 
	The answer lies in their financial education and mindset. Hard work alone is not enough if it’s not paired with the 
	right knowledge and strategies. <b>Financial education is the missing 
	piece—a guide to understanding how money works, how to manage it effectively, and how to make it grow. </b>
