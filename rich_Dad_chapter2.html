        <h1>CHAPTER 2 : WHY TEACHING FINANCIAL LITERACY </h1>
    
<p> In 1990, Mike took over his father's  empire and is, in
fact, doing a better job than his dad did.  Rich dad's empire is in
great hands, and Mike is now grooming his son to take his
place, as his dad had groomed us.

<b> In 1994, I retired at the age of 47, and my wife Kim was
37. Retirement does not mean not working. For us, it means
that, barring unforeseen cataclysmic changes, we can work
or not work, but our wealth grows automatically, staying
ahead of inflation. Our assets are large enough to grow by
themselves. It's like planting a tree. You water it for years,
and then one day it doesn't need you anymore. Its roots are
implanted deep enough. Then the tree provides shade for
your enjoyment. Mike chose to run the empire, and I chose to retire.</b> </p>


<p> Most people fail to realize that in life, it's not how much
money you make. It's how much money you keep. We have all
heard stories of lottery winners who are poor, then
suddenly rich, and then poor again. They win millions, yet
are soon back where they started. Or stories of professional
athletes, who at the age of 24 are earning millions, but are
sleeping under a bridge 10 years later. </p>

<p> I know so many people who became instant millionaires.
And while I am glad some people have become richer and
richer, I caution them that in the long run, it's not how
much money you make. It's how much you keep, and how
many generations you keep it.
So when people ask, " Where do I get started? or Tell
me how to get rich quick, "  they often are greatly
disappointed with my answer. I simply say to them what my
rich dad said to me when I was a little kid. " If you want to
be rich, you need to be financially literate. " </p>



<p> My rich dad poured a strong financial foundation for
Mike and me. Since we were just kids, he created a simple
way to teach us.
For years he only drew pictures and used few words.
Mike and I understood the simple drawings, the jargon, the
movement of money, and then in later years, rich dad began adding numbers- base for accounting. </p>

 
<h2> Rule #1: You must know the difference
between an asset and a liability, and buy
assets. </h2>  
    
  <p>   If you want to be rich, this is rule no :1 . Most people struggle financially
because they do not know the difference between an asset
and a liability. 
<b> <em> " Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class
acquire liabilities that they think are assets, " </b> </em> said rich dad.
" What is an asset ?" asked Mike. </p>

<p> Rich dad believed in the KISS principle " Keep It Simple,
Stupid (or Keep It Super Simple) " so he kept it simple for
us, and that made our financial foundation strong. </p>

<p> When students leave school without financial skills,
millions of educated people pursue their profession
successfully, but later find themselves struggling financially.
They work harder but don't get ahead. </p>
<p>  A person can be highly
educated, professionally successful, and financially
illiterate. These people often work harder than they need to
because they learned how to work hard, but not how to
have their money work hard for them. </p>

 <h2> Why the Rich Get Richer ? </h2>
<p> A review of my rich dad's financial statement shows why
the rich get richer. The asset column generates more than
enough income to cover expenses, with the balance
reinvested into the asset column. The asset column
continues to grow and, therefore, the income it produces
grows with it. The result is that the rich get richer! </p>


<h2> Why the Middle Class Struggle ? </h2>
<p> The middle class finds itself in a constant state of
financial struggle. Their primary income is through their
salary. As their wages increase, so do their taxes. Their
expenses tend to increase in proportion to their salary
increase: hence, the phrase <b> " the Rat Race". </b> They treat their
home as their primary asset, instead of investing in income producing assets. </p>


<p> As an employee , your working
efforts are generally as follows: <br> <br> 
1. <b> You work for the company. </b>
Employees make their business owner or the
shareholders rich, not themselves. Your efforts
and success will help provide for the owner's
success and retirement.
<br> <br>
2. <b> You work for the government. </b>
The government takes its share from your
paycheck before you even see it. By working
harder, you simply increase the amount of taxes
taken by the government. 
After taxes, your next largest expense is usually
your mortgage and credit-card debt. </p>

<p> <b> Just remember this simple observation : </b><br> <br>
 1. The rich buy assets - the next goal would be to have the excess cash flow from
the assets reinvested into the asset column.
The more
money that goes into the asset column, the more the asset
column grows. The more the assets grow, the more the cash
flow grows. <br> <br>
2.The poor only have expenses. <br> <br>
3.The middle class buy liabilities they think
are assets. <br> <br>
